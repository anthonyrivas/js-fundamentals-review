### Instructions

Loops

## 2. Try this - How would you output?
I am 1
I am 2
I am 3

## 3. Try this
* Starting from scratch, write code that loops through the following array and logs the name of each animal on the farm to the console:

```
var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];
```

* Then check if the first letter in the animal's name begins with a "c" or "o". If it does, create an alert saying, "Starts with 'c' or 'o'!"

* **HINT:** You can access the first character of a string as if it were the first element of an array.
