# Numbers in JavaScript
## Only one type of number in JavaScript and that is `Number`

## typeof
```
const age = 21; // this is an integer (but type is number)
const price = 100.52; // this is a float (but type is number)
```

`$ typeof age` ("number")

## math operators
```
+ add
- subtract
* multiple
/ divide
```

### casting
* if you multiply strings numbers, subtract or divide them JavaScript will cast them as a number (**note** but it won't when using `+`)

## JavaScript helper functions
* Math
    - .round()
    - .floor()
    - .ceil()
    - .random()

## Two other Math operators
* modulo
    - remainder
    - Type this in console `0.1 + 0.2`
    - Why?
    - Type this in console

```
window.location = `https://${0.1 + 0.2}.com`;
```

* **Tip** Don't store money in dollars and cents
    - This will prevent any strange JavaScript decimal behavior
    - You will always be working in whole numbers
    - Never working in fractions
    - Then you use an equation to convert number to dollars and cents
    - We'll discuss displaying money later


## power 
* There are numbers that are too high and too small for JavaScript
    - infinity
    - and negative infinity

```
> 10 ** 2
< 100
```

* Above `**` is "to the power of"

```
> 1000 ** 20
> Infinity
```

```
> -1000 ** 200
> Infinity
```

```
typeof Infinity // (number)
typeof -Infinity // (number)
```
## NaN
```
> 10 / 'word'
< NaN
```

* Not a Number

`typeof NaN //(number)`
